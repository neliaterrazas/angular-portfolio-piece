---

### Description

This site is meant to be a recreation of https://www.barneys.com/ using Angular.



### Technologies and Resources

* HTML
* Angular/Angular CLI
* CSS
* Node.js/npm

### Responsiveness

This site is still in basic set up when you first install angular. It is responsive.

### Setup Instructions

* Update/have latest version of Node.js and npm
* Globally install Angular/Angular cli ($ npm install -g @angular/cli@1.6.5)
* Download this repository at https://github.com/neliaterrazas/site.git onto your desktop and navigate into the folder.
* Run ($ npm i) to install dependencies.
* Run ($ ng serve --open) to see the site on your browser.

### Roadmap
At this moment, my site does not resemble the target site at all. I will first create and tackle the nav bar component, and from there continue creating new components separated out as the are on the original page. Once the main page looks something like the original, my next goal will be to implement my own database (using Firebase) to insert photos and clothes info.
